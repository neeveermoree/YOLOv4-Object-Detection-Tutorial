    "The described significant improvements are achieved by dividing the feature map into two parts, performing calculations on one of them, and then combining the result. CSPNet contributes to a more complete and versatile gradient calculation as the gradient flows differently through both sides. The reason for this is the direct separation of the feature map, which is why a gradient with different information and weak correlation flows in different parts of the CSP layer. Thus, CSPNet makes a significant contribution to solving the following problems:\n",
